1 Hear me, Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
 2 Guard my life, for I am faithful to you; save your servant who trusts in you.
 You are my God; 3 have mercy on me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
 4 Bring joy to your servant, Lord, for I put my trust in you.
 5 You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you.
 6 Hear my prayer, Lord; listen to my cry for mercy.
 7 When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.
 8 Among the gods there is none like you, Lord; no deeds can compare with yours.
 9 All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord; they will bring glory to your name.
 10 For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.
 11 Teach me your way, Lord, that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
 12 I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever.
 13 For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths, from the realm of the dead.
 14 Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; ruthless people are trying to kill me— they have no regard for you.
 15 But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.
 16 Turn to me and have mercy on me; show your strength in behalf of your servant; save me, because I serve you just as my mother did.
 17 Give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.
