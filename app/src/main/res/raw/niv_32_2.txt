1 From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God.
 2 He said:
 “In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
 From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and you listened to my cry.
 3 You hurled me into the depths, into the very heart of the seas, and the currents swirled about me; all your waves and breakers swept over me.
 4 I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.
’ 5 The engulfing waters threatened me,[a] the deep surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.
 6 To the roots of the mountains I sank down; the earth beneath barred me in forever.
 But you, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.
 7 “When my life was ebbing away, I remembered you, Lord, and my prayer rose to you, to your holy temple.
 8 “Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them.
 9 But I, with shouts of grateful praise, will sacrifice to you.
 What I have vowed I will make good.
 I will say, ‘Salvation comes from the Lord.
’” 10 And the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
