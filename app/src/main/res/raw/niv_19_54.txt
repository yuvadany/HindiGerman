1 Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.
 2 Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.
 3 Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me— people without regard for God.
[b] 4 Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.
 5 Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.
 6 I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good.
 7 You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
