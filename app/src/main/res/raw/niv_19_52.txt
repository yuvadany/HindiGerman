1 Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God? 2 You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor.
 3 You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.
[b] 4 You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue! 5 Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin:
 He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.
 6 The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying, 7 “Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!” 8 But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever.
 9 For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people.
 And I will hope in your name, for your name is good.
