1 Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy.
 2 For the Lord Most High is awesome, the great King over all the earth.
 3 He subdued nations under us, peoples under our feet.
 4 He chose our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob, whom he loved.
[b] 5 God has ascended amid shouts of joy, the Lord amid the sounding of trumpets.
 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises to our King, sing praises.
 7 For God is the King of all the earth; sing to him a psalm of praise.
 8 God reigns over the nations; God is seated on his holy throne.
 9 The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham, for the kings[c] of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.
