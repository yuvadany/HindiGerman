1 “‘If your offering is a fellowship offering, and you offer an animal from the herd, whether male or female, you are to present before the Lord an animal without defect.
 2 You are to lay your hand on the head of your offering and slaughter it at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
 Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash the blood against the sides of the altar.
 3 From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the Lord:
 the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them, 4 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys.
 5 Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar on top of the burnt offering that is lying on the burning wood; it is a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.
 6 “‘If you offer an animal from the flock as a fellowship offering to the Lord, you are to offer a male or female without defect.
 7 If you offer a lamb, you are to present it before the Lord, 8 lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting.
 Then Aaron’s sons shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar.
 9 From the fellowship offering you are to bring a food offering to the Lord:
 its fat, the entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them, 10 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys.
 11 The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord.
 12 “‘If your offering is a goat, you are to present it before the Lord, 13 lay your hand on its head and slaughter it in front of the tent of meeting.

 14 From what you offer you are to present this food offering to the Lord:
 the internal organs and all the fat that is connected to them, 15 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which you will remove with the kidneys.

 You must not eat any fat or any blood.
