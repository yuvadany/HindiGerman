1 How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity! 2 It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down on the collar of his robe.
 3 It is as if the dew of Hermon were falling on Mount Zion.
 For there the Lord bestows his blessing, even life forevermore.
