1 Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack.
 2 My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.
 3 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
 4 In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid.
 What can mere mortals do to me? 5 All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin.
 6 They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.
 7 Because of their wickedness do not[b] let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.
 8 Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll[c] — are they not in your record? 9 Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help.
 By this I will know that God is for me.
 10 In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord, whose word I praise— 11 in God I trust and am not afraid.
 What can man do to me? 12 I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you.
 13 For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
