1 Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever.
 2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people both now and forevermore.
 3 The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil.
 4 Lord, do good to those who are good, to those who are upright in heart.
 5 But those who turn to crooked ways the Lord will banish with the evildoers.
 Peace be on Israel.
