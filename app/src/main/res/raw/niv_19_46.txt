1 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.
 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
[b] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.
 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.
 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts.
 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
 8 Come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth.
 9 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.
 He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the shields[c] with fire.
 10 He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
” 11 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
