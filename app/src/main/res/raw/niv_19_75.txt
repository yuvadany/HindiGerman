1 We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds.
 2 You say, “I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge with equity.
 3 When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm.
[b] 4 To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.
[c] 5 Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.
’” 6 No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves.
 7 It is God who judges:
 He brings one down, he exalts another.
 8 In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.
 9 As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob, 10 who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
”
