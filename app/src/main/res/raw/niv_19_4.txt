1 Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God.
 Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
 2 How long will you people turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods[b][c] 3 Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
 4 Tremble and[d] do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent.
 5 Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the Lord.
 6 Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?” Let the light of your face shine on us.
 7 Fill my heart with joy when their grain and new wine abound.
 8 In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.
