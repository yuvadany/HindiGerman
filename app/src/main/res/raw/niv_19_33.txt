1 Sing joyfully to the Lord, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him.
 2 Praise the Lord with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre.
 3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy.
 4 For the word of the Lord is right and true; he is faithful in all he does.
 5 The Lord loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love.
 6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth.
 7 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars[a] ; he puts the deep into storehouses.
 8 Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the people of the world revere him.
 9 For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm.
 10 The Lord foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples.
 11 But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations.
 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he chose for his inheritance.
 13 From heaven the Lord looks down and sees all mankind; 14 from his dwelling place he watches all who live on earthâ€” 15 he who forms the hearts of all, who considers everything they do.
 16 No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.
 17 A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.
 18 But the eyes of the Lord are on those who fear him, on those whose hope is in his unfailing love, 19 to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.
 20 We wait in hope for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.
 21 In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name.
 22 May your unfailing love be with us, Lord, even as we put our hope in you.
