1 [a] Praise the Lord.
[b] Blessed are those who fear the Lord, who find great delight in his commands.
 2 Their children will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
 3 Wealth and riches are in their houses, and their righteousness endures forever.
 4 Even in darkness light dawns for the upright, for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.
 5 Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely, who conduct their affairs with justice.
 6 Surely the righteous will never be shaken; they will be remembered forever.
 7 They will have no fear of bad news; their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.
 8 Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear; in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.
 9 They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor, their righteousness endures forever; their horn[c] will be lifted high in honor.
 10 The wicked will see and be vexed, they will gnash their teeth and waste away; the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.
