1 May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
 2 May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion.
 3 May he remember all your sacrifices and accept your burnt offerings.
[b] 4 May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.
 5 May we shout for joy over your victory and lift up our banners in the name of our God.
 May the Lord grant all your requests.
 6 Now this I know:
 The Lord gives victory to his anointed.
 He answers him from his heavenly sanctuary with the victorious power of his right hand.
 7 Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
 8 They are brought to their knees and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.
 9 Lord, give victory to the king! Answer us when we call!
