1 Praise the Lord.
[a] Praise the Lord, you his servants; praise the name of the Lord.
 2 Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore.
 3 From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
 4 The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens.
 5 Who is like the Lord our God, the One who sits enthroned on high, 6 who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth? 7 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; 8 he seats them with princes, with the princes of his people.
 9 He settles the childless woman in her home as a happy mother of children.
 Praise the Lord.
