1 Lord my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me, 2 or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
 3 Lord my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands— 4 if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe— 5 then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.
[b] 6 Arise, Lord, in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies.
 Awake, my God; decree justice.
 7 Let the assembled peoples gather around you, while you sit enthroned over them on high.
 8 Let the Lord judge the peoples.
 Vindicate me, Lord, according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.
 9 Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure— you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts.
 10 My shield[c] is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.
 11 God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day.
 12 If he does not relent, he[d] will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.
 13 He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.
 14 Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
 15 Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made.
 16 The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads.
 17 I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.
