1 He has founded his city on the holy mountain.
 2 The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.
 3 Glorious things are said of you, city of God:
[a] 4 “I will record Rahab[b] and Babylon among those who acknowledge me— Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush[c] — and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.
’”[d] 5 Indeed, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.
” 6 The Lord will write in the register of the peoples:
 “This one was born in Zion.
” 7 As they make music they will sing, “All my fountains are in you.
”
