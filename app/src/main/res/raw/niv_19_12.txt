1 Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore; those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
 2 Everyone lies to their neighbor; they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts.
 3 May the Lord silence all flattering lips and every boastful tongue— 4 those who say, “By our tongues we will prevail; our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?” 5 “Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise,” says the Lord.
 “I will protect them from those who malign them.
” 6 And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver purified in a crucible, like gold[b] refined seven times.
 7 You, Lord, will keep the needy safe and will protect us forever from the wicked, 8 who freely strut about when what is vile is honored by the human race.
