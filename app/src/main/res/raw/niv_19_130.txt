1 Out of the depths I cry to you, Lord; 2 Lord, hear my voice.
 Let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy.
 3 If you, Lord, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand? 4 But with you there is forgiveness, so that we can, with reverence, serve you.
 5 I wait for the Lord, my whole being waits, and in his word I put my hope.
 6 I wait for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morning, more than watchmen wait for the morning.
 7 Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption.
 8 He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins.
