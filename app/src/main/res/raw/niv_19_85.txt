1 You, Lord, showed favor to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
 2 You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins.
[b] 3 You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.
 4 Restore us again, God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.
 5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations? 6 Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? 7 Show us your unfailing love, Lord, and grant us your salvation.
 8 I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servantsâ€” but let them not turn to folly.
 9 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.
 10 Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.
 11 Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.
 12 The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.
 13 Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.
