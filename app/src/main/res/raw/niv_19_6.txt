1 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
 2 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint; heal me, Lord, for my bones are in agony.
 3 My soul is in deep anguish.
 How long, Lord, how long? 4 Turn, Lord, and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.
 5 Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
 Who praises you from the grave? 6 I am worn out from my groaning.
 All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
 7 My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.
 8 Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.
 9 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.
 10 All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
