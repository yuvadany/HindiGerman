1 In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name.
 Take away our disgrace!” The Branch of the Lord 2 In that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.
 3 Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
 4 The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit[a] of judgment and a spirit[b] of fire.
 5 Then the Lord will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over everything the glory[c] will be a canopy.
 6 It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
