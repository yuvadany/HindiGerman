1 Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in obedience to him.
 2 You will eat the fruit of your labor; blessings and prosperity will be yours.
 3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table.
 4 Yes, this will be the blessing for the man who fears the Lord.
 5 May the Lord bless you from Zion; may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
 6 May you live to see your children’s children— peace be on Israel.
