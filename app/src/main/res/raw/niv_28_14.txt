1 Return, Israel, to the Lord your God.
 Your sins have been your downfall! 2 Take words with you and return to the Lord.
 Say to him:
 “Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips.
[a] 3 Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhorses.
 We will never again say ‘Our gods’ to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion.
” 4 “I will heal their waywardness and love them freely, for my anger has turned away from them.
 5 I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like a lily.
 Like a cedar of Lebanon he will send down his roots; 6 his young shoots will grow.
 His splendor will be like an olive tree, his fragrance like a cedar of Lebanon.
 7 People will dwell again in his shade; they will flourish like the grain, they will blossom like the vine— Israel’s fame will be like the wine of Lebanon.
 8 Ephraim, what more have I[b] to do with idols? I will answer him and care for him.
 I am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfulness comes from me.
” 9 Who is wise? Let them realize these things.
 Who is discerning? Let them understand.
 The ways of the Lord are right; the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in them.
