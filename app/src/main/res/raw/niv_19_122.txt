1 I rejoiced with those who said to me, “Let us go to the house of the Lord.
” 2 Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.
 3 Jerusalem is built like a city that is closely compacted together.
 4 That is where the tribes go up— the tribes of the Lord— to praise the name of the Lord according to the statute given to Israel.
 5 There stand the thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
 “May those who love you be secure.
 7 May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.
” 8 For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.
” 9 For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your prosperity.
