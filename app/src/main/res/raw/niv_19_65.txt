1 Praise awaits[b] you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.
 2 You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.
 3 When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave[c] our transgressions.
 4 Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.
 5 You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas, 6 who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength, 7 who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
 8 The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.
 9 You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly.
 The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
[d] 10 You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
 11 You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
 12 The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.
 13 The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
