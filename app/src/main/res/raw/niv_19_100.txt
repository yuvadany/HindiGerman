1 Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
 2 Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.
 3 Know that the Lord is God.
 It is he who made us, and we are his[a] ; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
 4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.
 5 For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.
