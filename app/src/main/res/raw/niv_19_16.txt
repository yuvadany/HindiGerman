1 Keep me safe, my God, for in you I take refuge.
 2 I say to the Lord, “You are my Lord; apart from you I have no good thing.
” 3 I say of the holy people who are in the land, “They are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.
” 4 Those who run after other gods will suffer more and more.
 I will not pour out libations of blood to such gods or take up their names on my lips.
 5 Lord, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.
 6 The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.
 7 I will praise the Lord, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.
 8 I keep my eyes always on the Lord.
 With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
 9 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest secure, 10 because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful[a] one see decay.
 11 You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.
