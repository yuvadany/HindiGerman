1 Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
 2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; worship the Lord in the splendor of his[a] holiness.
 3 The voice of the Lord is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
 4 The voice of the Lord is powerful; the voice of the Lord is majestic.
 5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
 6 He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion[b] like a young wild ox.
 7 The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning.
 8 The voice of the Lord shakes the desert; the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
 9 The voice of the Lord twists the oaks[c] and strips the forests bare.
 And in his temple all cry, “Glory!” 10 The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
 11 The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord blesses his people with peace.
