1 [a] Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation.
 Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked.
 2 You are God my stronghold.
 Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? 3 Send me your light and your faithful care, let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.
 4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight.
 I will praise you with the lyre, OÂ God, my God.
 5 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
