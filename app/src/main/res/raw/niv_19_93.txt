1 The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength; indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
 2 Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity.
 3 The seas have lifted up, Lord, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
 4 Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the seaâ€” the Lord on high is mighty.
 5 Your statutes, Lord, stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days.
