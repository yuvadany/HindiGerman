1 My heart is not proud, Lord, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.
 2 But I have calmed and quieted myself, I am like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child I am content.
 3 Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.
