1 Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, 2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night.
 3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not witherâ€” whatever they do prospers.
 4 Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
 5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
 6 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
