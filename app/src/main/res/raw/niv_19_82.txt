1 God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the “gods”:
 2 “How long will you[a] defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked?[b] 3 Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
 4 Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
 5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing.
 They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
 6 “I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High.
’ 7 But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler.
” 8 Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.
