1 Lord, how many are my foes! How many rise up against me! 2 Many are saying of me, “God will not deliver him.
”[b] 3 But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
 4 I call out to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain.
 5 I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me.
 6 I will not fear though tens of thousands assail me on every side.
 7 Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.
 8 From the Lord comes deliverance.
 May your blessing be on your people.
