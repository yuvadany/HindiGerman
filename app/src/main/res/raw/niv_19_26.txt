1 Vindicate me, Lord, for I have led a blameless life; I have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered.
 2 Test me, Lord, and try me, examine my heart and my mind; 3 for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.
 4 I do not sit with the deceitful, nor do I associate with hypocrites.
 5 I abhor the assembly of evildoers and refuse to sit with the wicked.
 6 I wash my hands in innocence, and go about your altar, Lord, 7 proclaiming aloud your praise and telling of all your wonderful deeds.
 8 Lord, I love the house where you live, the place where your glory dwells.
 9 Do not take away my soul along with sinners, my life with those who are bloodthirsty, 10 in whose hands are wicked schemes, whose right hands are full of bribes.
 11 I lead a blameless life; deliver me and be merciful to me.
 12 My feet stand on level ground; in the great congregation I will praise the Lord.
