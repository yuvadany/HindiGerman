1 I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me.
 2 Save me, Lord, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues.
 3 What will he do to you, and what more besides, you deceitful tongue? 4 He will punish you with a warriorâ€™s sharp arrows, with burning coals of the broom bush.
 5 Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek, that I live among the tents of Kedar! 6 Too long have I lived among those who hate peace.
 7 I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
