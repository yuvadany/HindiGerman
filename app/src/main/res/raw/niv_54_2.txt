1 I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people— 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
 3 This is good, and pleases God our Savior, 4 who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
 5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all people.
 This has now been witnessed to at the proper time.
 7 And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.
 8 Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.
 9 I also want the women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, adorning themselves, not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 10 but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
 11 A woman[a] should learn in quietness and full submission.
 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[b] she must be quiet.
 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
 15 But women[c] will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.
