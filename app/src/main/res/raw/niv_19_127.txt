1 Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.
 Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.
 2 In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat— for he grants sleep to[a] those he loves.
 3 Children are a heritage from the Lord, offspring a reward from him.
 4 Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one’s youth.
 5 Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them.
 They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court.
