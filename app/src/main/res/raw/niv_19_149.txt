1 Praise the Lord.
[a] Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the assembly of his faithful people.
 2 Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be glad in their King.
 3 Let them praise his name with dancing and make music to him with timbrel and harp.
 4 For the Lord takes delight in his people; he crowns the humble with victory.
 5 Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds.
 6 May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, 7 to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, 8 to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, 9 to carry out the sentence written against themâ€” this is the glory of all his faithful people.
 Praise the Lord.
