1 Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
 2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.
 3 They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.
 4 They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear.
 5 They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see it[b] ?” 6 They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.
 7 But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down.
 8 He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
 9 All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.
 10 The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!
