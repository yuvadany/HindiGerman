1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan[a] standing at his right side to accuse him.
 2 The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?” 3 Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
 4 The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.
” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.
” 5 Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.
” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by.
 6 The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:
 7 “This is what the Lord Almighty says:
 ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.
 8 “‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come:
 I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.
 9 See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes[b] on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.
 10 “‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
”
