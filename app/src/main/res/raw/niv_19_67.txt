1 May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on usâ€”[b] 2 so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations.
 3 May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you.
 4 May the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you rule the peoples with equity and guide the nations of the earth.
 5 May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you.
 6 The land yields its harvest; God, our God, blesses us.
 7 May God bless us still, so that all the ends of the earth will fear him.
