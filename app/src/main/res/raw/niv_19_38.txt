1 Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
 2 Your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down on me.
 3 Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.
 4 My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.
 5 My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.
 6 I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.
 7 My back is filled with searing pain; there is no health in my body.
 8 I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.
 9 All my longings lie open before you, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.
 10 My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.
 11 My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.
 12 Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie.
 13 I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak; 14 I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.
 15 Lord, I wait for you; you will answer, Lord my God.
 16 For I said, “Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.
” 17 For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
 18 I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.
 19 Many have become my enemies without cause[b] ; those who hate me without reason are numerous.
 20 Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good.
 21 Lord, do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God.
 22 Come quickly to help me, my Lord and my Savior.
