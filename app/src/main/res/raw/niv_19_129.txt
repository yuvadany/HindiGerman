1 “They have greatly oppressed me from my youth,” let Israel say; 2 “they have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me.
 3 Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long.
 4 But the Lord is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked.
” 5 May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame.
 6 May they be like grass on the roof, which withers before it can grow; 7 a reaper cannot fill his hands with it, nor one who gathers fill his arms.
 8 May those who pass by not say to them, “The blessing of the Lord be on you; we bless you in the name of the Lord.
”
