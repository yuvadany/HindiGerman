1 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens.
 2 Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.
 3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 4 what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?[b] 5 You have made them[c] a little lower than the angels[d] and crowned them[e] with glory and honor.
 6 You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their[f] feet:
 7 all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild, 8 the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
 9 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
