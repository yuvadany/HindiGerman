1 When the Lord restored the fortunes of[a] Zion, we were like those who dreamed.
[b] 2 Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy.
 Then it was said among the nations, “The Lord has done great things for them.
” 3 The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.
 4 Restore our fortunes,[c] Lord, like streams in the Negev.
 5 Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.
 6 Those who go out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with them.
