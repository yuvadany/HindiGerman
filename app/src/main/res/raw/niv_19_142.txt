1 I cry aloud to the Lord; I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
 2 I pour out before him my complaint; before him I tell my trouble.
 3 When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who watch over my way.
 In the path where I walk people have hidden a snare for me.
 4 Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me.
 I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.
 5 I cry to you, Lord; I say, “You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
” 6 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
 7 Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name.
 Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.
