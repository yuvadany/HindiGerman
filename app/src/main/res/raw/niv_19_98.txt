1 Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
 2 The Lord has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
 3 He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
 4 Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music; 5 make music to the Lord with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing, 6 with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn— shout for joy before the Lord, the King.
 7 Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.
 8 Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy; 9 let them sing before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.
 He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples with equity.
