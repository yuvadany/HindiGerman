1 In the Lord I take refuge.
 How then can you say to me:
 “Flee like a bird to your mountain.
 2 For look, the wicked bend their bows; they set their arrows against the strings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
 3 When the foundations are being destroyed, what can the righteous do?” 4 The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord is on his heavenly throne.
 He observes everyone on earth; his eyes examine them.
 5 The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.
 6 On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.
 7 For the Lord is righteous, he loves justice; the upright will see his face.
