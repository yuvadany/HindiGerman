1 How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty! 2 My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
 3 Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young— a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God.
 4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.
[b] 5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
 6 As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.
[c] 7 They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.
 8 Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob.
 9 Look on our shield,[d] O God; look with favor on your anointed one.
 10 Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
 11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.
 12 Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.
