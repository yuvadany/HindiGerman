1 When Israel came out of Egypt, Jacob from a people of foreign tongue, 2 Judah became Godâ€™s sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
 3 The sea looked and fled, the Jordan turned back; 4 the mountains leaped like rams, the hills like lambs.
 5 Why was it, sea, that you fled? Why, Jordan, did you turn back? 6 Why, mountains, did you leap like rams, you hills, like lambs? 7 Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 8 who turned the rock into a pool, the hard rock into springs of water.
