1 I will sing of your love and justice; to you, Lord, I will sing praise.
 2 I will be careful to lead a blameless lifeâ€” when will you come to me? I will conduct the affairs of my house with a blameless heart.
 3 I will not look with approval on anything that is vile.
 I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it.
 4 The perverse of heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with what is evil.
 5 Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not tolerate.
 6 My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; the one whose walk is blameless will minister to me.
 7 No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.
 8 Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the Lord.
