1 I will exalt you, Lord, for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.
 2 Lord my God, I called to you for help, and you healed me.
 3 You, Lord, brought me up from the realm of the dead; you spared me from going down to the pit.
 4 Sing the praises of the Lord, you his faithful people; praise his holy name.
 5 For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.
 6 When I felt secure, I said, “I will never be shaken.
” 7 Lord, when you favored me, you made my royal mountain[b] stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.
 8 To you, Lord, I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:
 9 “What is gained if I am silenced, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness? 10 Hear, Lord, and be merciful to me; Lord, be my help.
” 11 You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, 12 that my heart may sing your praises and not be silent.
 Lord my God, I will praise you forever.
