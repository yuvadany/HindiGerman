1 Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord, to help me.
 2 May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
 3 May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame.
 4 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!” 5 But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God.
 You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay.
