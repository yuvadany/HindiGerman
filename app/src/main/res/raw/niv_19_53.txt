1 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.
” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.
 2 God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
 3 Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
 4 Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God.
 5 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread.
 God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.
 6 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
