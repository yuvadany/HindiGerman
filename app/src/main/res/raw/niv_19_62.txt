1 Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him.
 2 Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
 3 How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down— this leaning wall, this tottering fence? 4 Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies.
 With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse.
[b] 5 Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him.
 6 Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
 7 My salvation and my honor depend on God[c] ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
 8 Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.
 9 Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie.
 If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.
 10 Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
 11 One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard:
 “Power belongs to you, God, 12 and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.
”
