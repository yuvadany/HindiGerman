1 Praise be to the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.
 2 He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples[a] under me.
 3 Lord, what are human beings that you care for them, mere mortals that you think of them? 4 They are like a breath; their days are like a fleeting shadow.
 5 Part your heavens, Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.
 6 Send forth lightning and scatter the enemy; shoot your arrows and rout them.
 7 Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners 8 whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.
 9 I will sing a new song to you, my God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you, 10 to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David.
 From the deadly sword 11 deliver me; rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.
 12 Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
 13 Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision.
 Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields; 14 our oxen will draw heavy loads.
[b] There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.
 15 Blessed is the people of whom this is true; blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.
