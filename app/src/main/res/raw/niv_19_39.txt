1 I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked.
” 2 So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good.
 But my anguish increased; 3 my heart grew hot within me.
 While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
 4 “Show me, Lord, my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.
 5 You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you.
 Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.
[b] 6 “Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be.
 7 “But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.
 8 Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.
 9 I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.
 10 Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
 11 When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, you consume their wealth like a moth— surely everyone is but a breath.
 12 “Hear my prayer, Lord, listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping.
 I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
 13 Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more.
”
