1 Lord, remember David and all his self-denial.
 2 He swore an oath to the Lord, he made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
 3 “I will not enter my house or go to my bed, 4 I will allow no sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, 5 till I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.
” 6 ¨nloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self? control, brutal, despisers of good, y I have become your Father”[a] 7 “Let us go to his dwelling place, let us worship at his footstool, saying, 8 ‘Arise, Lord, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might.
 9 May your priests be clothed with your righteousness; may your faithful people sing for joy.
’” 10 For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed one.
 11 The Lord swore an oath to David, a sure oath he will not revoke:
 “One of your own descendants I will place on your throne.
 12 If your sons keep my covenant and the statutes I teach them, then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever.
” 13 For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for his dwelling, saying, 14 “This is my resting place for ever and ever; here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it.
 15 I will bless her with abundant provisions; her poor I will satisfy with food.
 16 I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful people will ever sing for joy.
 17 “Here I will make a horn[b] grow for David and set up a lamp for my anointed one.
 18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.
”
