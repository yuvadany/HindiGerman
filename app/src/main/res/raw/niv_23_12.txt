1 In that day you will say:
 “I will praise you, Lord.
 Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you have comforted me.
 2 Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid.
 The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defense[a] ; he has become my salvation.
” 3 With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
 4 In that day you will say:
 “Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done, and proclaim that his name is exalted.
 5 Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world.
 6 Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.
”
