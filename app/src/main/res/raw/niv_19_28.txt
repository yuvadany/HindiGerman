1 To you, Lord, I call; you are my Rock, do not turn a deaf ear to me.
 For if you remain silent, I will be like those who go down to the pit.
 2 Hear my cry for mercy as I call to you for help, as I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those who do evil, who speak cordially with their neighbors but harbor malice in their hearts.
 4 Repay them for their deeds and for their evil work; repay them for what their hands have done and bring back on them what they deserve.
 5 Because they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord and what his hands have done, he will tear them down and never build them up again.
 6 Praise be to the Lord, for he has heard my cry for mercy.
 7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in him, and he helps me.
 My heart leaps for joy, and with my song I praise him.
 8 The Lord is the strength of his people, a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
 9 Save your people and bless your inheritance; be their shepherd and carry them forever.
