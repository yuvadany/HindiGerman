1 Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time:
 2 “Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.
” 3 Jonah obeyed the word of the Lord and went to Nineveh.
 Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it.
 4 Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.
” 5 The Ninevites believed God.
 A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth.
 6 When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.
 7 This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh:
 “By the decree of the king and his nobles:
 Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink.
 8 But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth.
 Let everyone call urgently on God.
 Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
 9 Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.
” 10 When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.
