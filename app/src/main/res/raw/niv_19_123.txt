1 I lift up my eyes to you, to you who sit enthroned in heaven.
 2 As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till he shows us his mercy.
 3 Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for we have endured no end of contempt.
 4 We have endured no end of ridicule from the arrogant, of contempt from the proud.
