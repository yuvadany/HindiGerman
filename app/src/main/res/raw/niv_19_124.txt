1 If the Lord had not been on our side— let Israel say— 2 if the Lord had not been on our side when people attacked us, 3 they would have swallowed us alive when their anger flared against us; 4 the flood would have engulfed us, the torrent would have swept over us, 5 the raging waters would have swept us away.
 6 Praise be to the Lord, who has not let us be torn by their teeth.
 7 We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.
 8 Our help is in the name of the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.
