1 The fool[a] says in his heart, “There is no God.
” They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.
 2 The Lord looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
 3 All have turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
 4 Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on the Lord.
 5 But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is present in the company of the righteous.
 6 You evildoers frustrate the plans of the poor, but the Lord is their refuge.
 7 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
