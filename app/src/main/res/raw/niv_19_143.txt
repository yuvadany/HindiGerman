1 Lord, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief.
 2 Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.
 3 The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in the darkness like those long dead.
 4 So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.
 5 I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.
 6 I spread out my hands to you; I thirst for you like a parched land.
[a] 7 Answer me quickly, Lord; my spirit fails.
 Do not hide your face from me or I will be like those who go down to the pit.
 8 Let the morning bring me word of your unfailing love, for I have put my trust in you.
 Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life.
 9 Rescue me from my enemies, Lord, for I hide myself in you.
 10 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
 11 For your nameâ€™s sake, Lord, preserve my life; in your righteousness, bring me out of trouble.
 12 In your unfailing love, silence my enemies; destroy all my foes, for I am your servant.
