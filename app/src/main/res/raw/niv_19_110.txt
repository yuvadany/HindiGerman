1 The Lord says to my lord:
[a] “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
” 2 The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying, “Rule in the midst of your enemies!” 3 Your troops will be willing on your day of battle.
 Arrayed in holy splendor, your young men will come to you like dew from the morning’s womb.
[b] 4 The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind:
 “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
” 5 The Lord is at your right hand[c] ; he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.
 6 He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.
 7 He will drink from a brook along the way,[d] and so he will lift his head high.
